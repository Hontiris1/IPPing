# IPPing
This script will ping every IP on a txt document, and report data for each individual IP.

*Future Updates*

- GUI containing the list of IPs on IPlist.txt, which will replace the contents function only displaying a print of the list at the moment.

*Added*

- Clear Reports button.
- Reports with a time/date format on the tittle will be generated everytime a new scan is performed.
- Everytime you start IPPing it will reset the Reports log, everytime a new Scan is performed it will append with a date/time above each log. You have the option to clear this log by pressing the Clear Reports button.
- Functions need to be finished, they are currently not fully working.
- GUI for Users using the functions.
